      "When McKim reached France, he began a ten-day tour of Normandy, the northern French region so popular with the court of Louis Napoléon. Along the Channel coast, summer visitors now flocked to what had once been a quiet agricultural region. Tourists had come to Normandy from the 1830s onward, and English architects sketched the giant vernacular farm buildings and the manor houses. Deauville and Trouville became resorts. The trip to these villages had been arduous until the railroad pushed through from Paris to Rouen, and again in 1854 to the coastal towns. Visitors found cool breezes, picturesque vistas, and great fishing in the region in the early days. The area especially attracted the newly made men of wealth in industrial France who did not have the loyalty to their home districts of the landed aristocratic class. They would build commodious, wooden-framed summer villas along the coast from the mid-century forward. The new houses often used elements of the vernacular buildings of the region, such as brick infilling between timbers and decorative woodwork, to create a harmonious appearance and reflect the older buildings nearby. Such coastal houses were also being built in northern Germany. The new villas appear taller and more vertical in contrast to the horizontal appearance of the older farm complexes and manors of the region, which sprawl heavier and lower to the land.</s><s> So the answer to the question 'what did they know about the Nazis' crimes?' is, frustratingly, 'not very much'. There were a few indications that – in retrospect – hinted at dark deeds, not least Martin Bormann's vindictive, high-handed behaviour, but beyond that little of any substance. We must conclude – paradoxically perhaps – that the gilded cage of the Berghof, or of Hitler's entourage, was not the best vantage point from which to view the true murderous nature of Nazism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed it was Martin Bormann who – as much as Hitler – played a key role in the lives and careers of the Berghof staff. As Hitler's personal secretary, Bormann assumed responsibility for the day-to-day running of the entire Berghof area, as well as overseeing the building's expansion in 1936. In this capacity, he became known as the 'Lord of the Obersalzberg', and sought to exercise authority over the Berghof staff, and was responsible for the dismissal of Anna Plaim in 1943, considering her unsuitable for service because of her parents' religious faith. Herbert Döhring also got on the wrong side of Bormann, and only earned the latter's respect through his robust self-defence.</s><s> Those cold blue eyes glued my tongue. I sat without moving.\n",

The preface refers to the heretics' \"plausible system.\" This plausibility he proceeds very cleverly and often wittily to undermine, unafraid to go into detailed exposition of Gnostic theosophical superstructures, even to the point of boredom—part of his method for undermining the grip of the Gnostics' plausibility. One thing he wants his readers to recognize is that \"Their language resembles ours, while their sentiments are very different.\" This is still a resonant observation and subverts the notion, often held today, that, _well,_ they were all _Christians,_ weren't they? Not in the view of Irenaeus! They were outsiders to the communion of the apostolic faithful and should repent of their blasphemies before seeking reentry to the fold. The orthodox majority, under such leaders as Irenaeus, would never allow an esoteric branch of the faith with superior tendencies to thrive: too much like competition, to say the very least.</s><s> Introduction\n",
      "The Roman Superhighway or Bataan Provincial Highway, formerly known as the Bataan Provincial Expressway, is a , two- to four-lane major highway that connects the municipality of Dinalupihan to the municipality of Mariveles in Bataan, Philippines. The entire road forms part of National Route 301 of the Philippine highway network.\n",
      "\n",
      "Etymology\n",
      "Roman Superhighway is named after Pablo Roman Sr., the former representative of Bataan who is the acknowledged father of the export processing zone known as Bataan Export Processing Zone (BEPZ; now known as Freeport Area of Bataan (FAB) since June 30, 2010).\n",
      " History \n",
      "Construction of the Roman Superhighway began on April 7, 1973 during the Martial Law period and completed on July 16, 1977. The project was implemented by President Ferdinand Marcos. It was originally intended to be an expressway to serve BEPZ in Mariveles, Bataan, but it later became an at-grade highway when local residents built houses and businesses along it.\n",
      "The fully concrete road has an effective width of , although some portions measured up to maximum. Phase 1 of the total project covered from Dinalupihan to Alauli Junction in Pilar and it measured long and complemented with 14 steel-concrete bridges. Phase 2 is measured and has 12 bridges.\n",
      "Construction Development Corporation of the Philippines (CDCP) and Monark International worked on the project. CDCP accomplished its task in three years and three months. Phase 2 was completed by Monark in two years and 11 months. The Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) designed and supervised the construction of the road project. Phase 1 costs , while was spent for Phase 2. The total amount includes the payment for the right-of-way of former agricultural lands. Some of the farmlots were even donated by the owners.\n",
      "Throughout its existence, rehabilitation works were made on the highway such as applying asphalt overlay either on an existing concrete pavement or both the concrete pavement and the asphalt used on its shoulders and replacing an old pavement with a new one. Recently, some of its portions were widened to accommodate more\n"
